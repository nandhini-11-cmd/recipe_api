                                         Recipe CRUD API

This is a simple backend application built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB (Atlas) to manage a collection of recipes. It allows users to perform all CRUD operations â€” Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to keep the code clean and organized. All endpoints are tested using Postman, and the exported Postman collection is included for easy testing.
